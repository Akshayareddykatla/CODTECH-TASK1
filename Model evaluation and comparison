Overview of the project: Model evaluation and comparison

Model Evaluation Objectives:

Performance Measurement: Assess the RL agent's performance in the game environment using metrics such as:
Cumulative rewards
Win/loss rate
Game completion time
Score or points achieved
Stability and Consistency: Evaluate the agent's ability to maintain performance over time, including:
Variance in rewards or scores
Consistency in decision-making
Robustness and Generalization: Test the agent's ability to adapt to:
New game levels or scenarios
Changes in game dynamics or rules
Different initial conditions or starting states
Efficiency and Scalability: Measure the agent's computational efficiency and scalability, including:
Training time and resources required
Inference time and resources required
Model Comparison Objectives:

Performance Comparison: Compare the performance of different RL agents or algorithms, including:
Cumulative rewards or scores
Win/loss rates
Game completion times
Algorithmic Differences: Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different RL algorithms, including:
Q-Learning vs. SARSA vs. DQN vs. PGMs
On-policy vs. off-policy learning
Model-based vs. model-free learning
Hyperparameter Sensitivity: Analyze the sensitivity of RL agents to hyperparameter changes, including:
Learning rate
Exploration rate
Discount factor
Batch size
Ablation Studies: Perform ablation studies to understand the contribution of individual components or features to the agent's performance, including:
Feature importance
Component removal or addition Technologies used: Sklearn Pandas:used for data manipulation and analysis
